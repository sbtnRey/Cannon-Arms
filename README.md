# Cannon Arms
A VR tower defense game in which one is defending the island they are on from incoming boats. The general concept circulates around the player having cannon arms and is defending their island/treasure chest from incoming ships. The game will have a score based system in which the players points will rise for each ship sunk. After a set amount of ships have been destroyed, the spawn rate and speed of the ships will increase.

## Build instructions
To run the game one has to use an older version of Unity (2017.1.0), this is due to using the VRTK library as a new one is still in development and still lacks many of the tools used for this games development. Both VRTK and the SteamVR libraries are included in the build. 

### Prerequisites
* HTC Vive (HardWare)
* Unity 2017.1.0
