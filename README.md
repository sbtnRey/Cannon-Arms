# Cannon Arms
A VR tower defense game in which one is defending the island they are on from incoming boats. The general concept circulates around the player having cannon arms and is defending their island/treasure chest from incoming ships. The game will have a score based system in which the players points will rise for each ship sunk. After a set amount of ships have been destroyed, the spawn rate and speed of the ships will increase.
